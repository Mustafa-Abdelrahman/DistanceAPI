# DistanceAPI
This is a sample API made using .Net Core 6.0 and a demonstration of creating an API solution that follows Clean Architechture,  SOLID desing princples and Strategy Design Pattern.

*After downloading this repository you'll find the solution consisting of two solution folders 'src' and 'Tests'

*In 'src' there are three projects 'DistanceCalculator.Core', 'DistanceCalculator.Application', and 'DistanceCalculator.Web'

*In 'tests' there are three projects 'DistanceCalculator.Web.IntegrationTests' and 'DistanceCalculator.Application.UnitTests'

1- 'DistanceCalculator.Core' : holds the domain entitis and types are.
2- 'DistanceCalculator.Application' : has the business logic of the application and strategy contracts and implementations
3- 'DistanceCalculator.Web' : is the .Net core web api app

4- 'DistanceCalculator.Application.UnitTests' : holds all possible unit tests
5- 'DistanceCalculator.Web.IntegrationTests' : holds all possible integration tests of the API app
